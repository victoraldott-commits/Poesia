Riding with ma homies
everything all right

The world is gonna roll me
but never with ma homies

Sad but true no more lies
youre gonna go deep inside
take the wheels and drive

Be free and be glad you're alive
you can transcend every day in a life
the dogs in the hood with no roof

Riding with ma homies
everything all right

The world is gonna roll me
but never with ma homies
